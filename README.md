# owostat.us [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mathhulk/owostat.us.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mathhulk/owostat.us)
owostat.us is used for displaying the public status of services and domains from OwO. owostat.us has been made using Node.js and uses a multitude of HTTP requests to attempt connections to OwO services and domains. OwO does not have a public website for displaying the status of their services and domains, thus the purpose that this project serves.

## Contribute
Feel free to contribute to the development of owostat.us through pull requests and issue/bug reporting. Contributions are always welcome and will help make this project the best that it can be. To get started, clone this project to a local folder.

### Run
Node.js and npm must be installed before you can use owostat.us. I also suggest that Yarn be used instead of npm for managing packages.
* Execute `yarn` to install packages and generate a lock file
* Execute `npm run start` to initialize owostat.us, which can be found on port 8999
